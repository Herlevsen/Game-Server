# Game-Server Project
Project about network communication between a game server and multiple game clients. Written in Java.

## Server
Server assigns each client a unique id on connection  
Server runs on port 9898

## Client
Client has a unique Id, assigned by the server.  
Client chooses a name. The name has to be unique, for the purpose of recognition. The server will validate this.
